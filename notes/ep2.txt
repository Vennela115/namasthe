git and git hub both are different
npm is not equal to node package manager it has different names but we can say it as package manager
packaGE.JSON is configuration of npm
webpack ,parcel , vite are bundlers of react they pack all files for production
^ caret upgrades  packagejson to minor versions
~tlide upgrades packagejson to major version

PACKAGE.LOCKJSON
it keeps a track of exact day to day version
package json depends on parcel and parcel depend on others which is said to be transitive dependency
nodumodules is  like database
if we have packagejson or  packagelockjson we can reload all nodemodules again
npm is same like npx,npx is used for executing npm modules
react can be bought by npm or cdn links
cdn is not preferred way of bringing react into our project so we use npm
npm i is short form of npm install


//if u want run code in new company just go through scripts  in package jsonand u can easily run the project


parcel does all these
--devbuild
